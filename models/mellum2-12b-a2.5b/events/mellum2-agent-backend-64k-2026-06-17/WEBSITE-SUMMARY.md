### Identity and scope

- Profile: `mellum2-12b-a2.5b-llamacpp-q4km-instruct` — llama.cpp Q4_K_M (Instruct)
- Evidence maturity: **SPECIALIZED_TEST**
- Evidence scope: specialized, agent-backend
- Hardware: WumboJetsII (RTX 5070 12GB)

Instruct + Thinking Q4_K_M through LLMGauge agent-backend-v1 at 64k on WumboJetsII. 64k fit confirmed (Instruct 5/5 complete, 251.0-257.2 tok/s out, 9203 MiB peak VRAM). Manual scores: Instruct preferred (overall trust 3.7/5) over Thinking; neither safe for unsupervised shell/systemd operations. Not a general model-quality verdict.

This event is a bounded public-safe summary derived from retained WumboLabs evidence.
It is not a WELP characterization, a universal model ranking, or a production-readiness
proof. Values are attributed to the tested artifact, runtime, hardware, suite, and settings.

Related tested profile: `mellum2-12b-a2.5b-llamacpp-q4km-thinking` — both variants were tested in the same event.
